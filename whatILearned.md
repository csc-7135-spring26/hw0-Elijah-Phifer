# What I've learned...

## I've learned...

What issues are for. I have used github for a while but only for small projects on small teams. So I've never used the issues feature.

## What's next...

I might start using issues when assigning tasks to my undergrads on projects. That way they have a written and detailed account of what should be implemented
